# LVGL with SSD1306 on BeagleBone

This project aims to integrate a graphical user interface (GUI) created with LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) displayed on an SSD1306 OLED screen, controlled by a BeagleBone board. The project will demonstrate the process of setting up a Yocto-based Linux image, integrating LVGL, interfacing with the SSD1306 OLED display, and creating a simple yet interactive GUI application.

## Project Objectives

- To build a custom Linux image using Yocto Project for BeagleBone.
- To integrate LVGL for creating GUI applications.
- To develop a driver or interface mechanism for communicating between LVGL and the SSD1306 OLED screen.
- To create a simple GUI application as a demonstration.

## Prerequisites

- BeagleBone Board (any variant compatible with Yocto Project)
- SSD1306 OLED Display (128x64 pixels, I2C interface)
- Basic knowledge of the C programming language
- Familiarity with Linux, especially command-line tools and the Yocto Project
- Access to a Linux development environment for running Yocto builds

## Step 1: Setting Up the Yocto Project Environment

1. Clone the Poky repository from the Yocto Project:

    ```bash
    git clone -b dunfell git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git yocto-dunfell
    ```

2. Initialize the Yocto build environment:

    ```bash
    cd yocto-dunfell
    source oe-init-build-env build
    ```

3. Configure the build for BeagleBone by editing `conf/local.conf` and `conf/bblayers.conf` as necessary.

## Step 2: Adding Necessary Layers

- Include `meta-openembedded`, `meta-lvgl`, and `meta-beagleboard` layers to your build environment.
- Customize `conf/bblayers.conf` to include these layers.

## Step 3: Developing the SSD1306 Driver/Interface

- Explore existing Linux drivers for SSD1306 and how they expose the display to user space.
- Determine the best approach to interface with the display (e.g., via framebuffer or direct I2C).

## Step 4: Integrating LVGL

- Ensure LVGL is included in your Yocto build and that it's configured to work with your display setup.

## Step 5: Creating Your GUI Application

- Design your GUI using LVGL's API.
- Implement the display driver callbacks in your application to communicate with the SSD1306 display.

## Step 6: Building and Testing

- Compile your GUI application along with LVGL for the BeagleBone.
- Deploy the application to your BeagleBone and test the GUI on the SSD1306 display.

## Conclusion

This README outlines the basic steps to get started with developing a GUI application using LVGL on a BeagleBone board with an SSD1306 OLED display. The project serves as an excellent learning opportunity for embedded systems enthusiasts looking to delve into GUI development, Yocto Project, and driver integration.
