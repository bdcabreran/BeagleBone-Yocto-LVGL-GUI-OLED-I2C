# Loading `uEnv.txt` in U-Boot and Applying Configurations

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to load `uEnv.txt` and apply its configurations directly from the U-Boot prompt, ensuring changes persist across reboots, this implies you already have a uEnv.txt file in the boot partition of your booteable SD-Card

## Steps to Apply `uEnv.txt` Configurations

1. **Interrupt Boot Process**:
    - During the device startup, interrupt the autoboot process by pressing any key when you see `Hit any key to stop autoboot:`.

2. **Execute Commands in U-Boot**:
    - To load `uEnv.txt` from the MMC device, import its environment variables, save these changes, and reset the device, execute the following commands in the U-Boot prompt:

        ```bash
        load mmc 0:1 ${loadaddr} uEnv.txt
        env import -t ${loadaddr} ${filesize}
        saveenv
        reset
        ```

    - **Explanation of Commands**:
        - `load mmc 0:1 ${loadaddr} uEnv.txt`: Loads `uEnv.txt` from the first partition (`1`) of the first MMC device (`0`) into memory.
        - `env import -t ${loadaddr} ${filesize}`: Imports environment variables from the loaded `uEnv.txt`.
        - `saveenv`: Saves the current environment to make the changes persistent across reboots.
        - `reset`: Resets the device to reboot with the new configurations.

## Additional Notes

- **Memory Address**: `${loadaddr}` is a predefined U-Boot environment variable specifying the memory address for loading files. Ensure this address does not overlap with other critical memory areas.
- **Device and Partition**: This procedure assumes `uEnv.txt` is located on the first partition of the first MMC device. Adjust the device and partition numbers based on your configuration.
- **File Path**: Confirm that `uEnv.txt` is properly named and located in the root directory of the specified partition.
- **Error Handling**: If commands fail (e.g., if `uEnv.txt` is not found), U-Boot will report errors. Ensure `uEnv.txt` is accessible.
- **Recovery Plan**: Have a plan for system recovery in case the new settings prevent proper booting.

This guide helps in manually applying `uEnv.txt` configurations from the U-Boot command line, ensuring immediate use and persistence through device reboots.
